Its vast expanse hosts tons of golden beaches, 900 islands, over 2,900 individual reefs, and thousands of incredibly diverse species, hence its complexity. Although the reef faces danger and death from environmental changes, the reef is still a beautiful place to visit.</p>

      <p> France's magnetic City of Light is a perennial tourist destination, drawing visitors with its iconic attractions, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Quaint cafes, trendy shopping districts and Haussmann architecture give Paris its timeless beauty.

To best explore France's ever-changing capital, get lost wandering the charming cobblestone streets, learn its secrets on a walking tour, head to dynamic art exhibits like the Atelier des Lumières or gourmandize at the latest restaurants and pastry shops</p>
